This site also offers several options such as importing your standard schedule, organizing your different schedules, filtering certain events (for example classes or practical work), integrating your personal activities, visualizing the premises and their location, and many other things!<br><br>Known as ADE Scheduler, this tool was created in August 2019 by three students then entering their master's degree. Their goal was to offer a more complete and user-friendly alternative to the official timetable tool then in place. After five years of growing popularity and use by tens of thousands of students at UCLouvain, it became the official tool in September 2024, changing its name to <strong>My Schedule</strong>.<br><br>Free software originally developed by Gilles Poncelet, Louis Navarre and JÃ©rome Eertmans, <strong>My Schedule</strong> is now maintained by the UCLouvain IT teams."
